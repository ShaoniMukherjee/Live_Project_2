# Live_Project_2
This is the second live project 
The project is to classify the password strength given the password. The problem is a multiclass problem with three labels 0,1,2 and one independent column.
The problem fits well with logistic regression. Further, I have used NLP technique to transform the dataset which can be fed to the model.
